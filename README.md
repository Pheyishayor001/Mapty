# Mapty

This is an application that is used to log in events of one's workout (either cycling or running) on a map. The map was gotten through a third-party library (leaflet).

the geoLocation API gets the user's current location and loads the map. The user can then select a position on the map where they will like to carryout their workout.

I used object oriented programming and also made use of the localStorage API to make the data inputed persist after refreshing the browser. along side some other features.
